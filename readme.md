# The way it works âš™
Whilst by design Elementor widget generates simple grid of elements.

Prepared code provides interesting new way of focusing users attention by introducing motion.

Taking inspiration from modern web animations I prepared a all-in-one, customizable solution which converts said grid into just one row. It's elements are then simply animated so that they provide carousel-like slider.

# Settings
One of priorities in development of this solution of it's versatility.

That's way at the top of the script there is a section of predefined variables which may be used to adjust the code to your specific need.
